1- Create an Auth file named "hcb_auth.json" with at least 1 admin accounts inside.

Example with 2 admin accounts :
{
    "accounts": [
        {
            "username": "u",
            "password": "p"
        },
        {
            "username": "user1",
            "password": "password1"
        }
    ]
}


Make a "cook-book.db" SQLite3 database that matches the migration file in /migrations

Done !
